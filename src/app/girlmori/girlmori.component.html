    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <div class="section">


    <div  class="textbox">

    
        <p >Back in 2020, the indie game OMORI was released by OMOCAT and took the world by storm. I started this project out of love for the game and its community, and ended up collaborating with over fourteen talented programmers and artists. I managed the mod from start to finish and guided the team on artwork, animations, programming features, and more. I also hand-made a majority of the assets and even learned how to program to go into the code myself and change in-game events and dialogue. I wanted to catch every detail I could and put out the best mod possible.  <br>

        <br>As of 2025, the mod has over 4000 downloads and has been featured in many fan videos and other mods across the world.

    <h3>Design Goals</h3>

        <p >The ultimate goal of the mod was to recreate the game with a girl protagonist as accurately as possible. This meant closely studying the art style of OMORI and hand-drawing/animating many of the assets. Assets that couldnâ€™t be hand-drawn were created via photomanipulation and collage in Photoshop. I taught this method to everyone working on the project to achieve a consistent style that would blend into the base game perfectly.     <br>
            <br> Any asset produced that I felt needed some touchups was either directly edited by me or sent back to the original artist with detailed instructions and examples.
